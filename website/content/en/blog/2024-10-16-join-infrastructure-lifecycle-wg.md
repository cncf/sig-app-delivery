Are you looking to influence the future of infrastructure management in cloud-native environments? The [CNCF](https://www.cncf.io/) Technical Oversight Committee [has recently approved](https://github.com/cncf/toc/issues/1383#issuecomment-2328220233) the Infrastructure Lifecycle working group within the [TAG App Delivery](https://tag-app-delivery.cncf.io/), **and we need your expertise\!**

As cloud-native practices evolve, infrastructure needs are becoming more complex. IT professionals now face the challenge of managing workloads across different environments. These include cloud platforms, IoT edge devices, on-premises data centers, and hybrid setups. There were already considerable investments in both open-source and commercial solutions. However, IT professionals still look for standards that address the whole infrastructure lifecycle.

This working group aims to define technology-agnostic best practices in infrastructure lifecycle management. We will deliver a framework for managing the lifecycle of cloud-native infrastructure, with a focus on components such as:

- Infrastructure as Code
- Control Planes
- State Management
- Disaster Recovery
- Automation
- Testing
- Observability

To accomplish our deliverable, we need your help in collaborating with relevant Technical Advisory Groups (TAGs), Working Groups (WGs), vendors, and end-users to integrate domain-specific expertise. Your participation will help us develop practical, real-world solutions that address the diverse needs of the community. Every voice matters, and we warmly welcome and encourage contributions from everyone interested in this field\! ðŸŽ¤

Co-chaired by [Ryan Nowak](https://github.com/rynowak) (Microsoft), [Bruno Schaatsbergen](https://github.com/bschaatsbergen) (HashiCorp), and [Jochen Zehnder](https://github.com/elft3r) (Inventx) and various active members, the group brings together expertise from leading industry professionals.
