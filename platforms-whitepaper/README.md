# Platforms white paper

CNCF TAG App Delivery maintains and publishes this paper describing platforms
for cloud-native computing to support project maintainers and cloud users in
planning and designing such platforms.

## Versioning
v1 was completed in March 2023; improvements and iterations continue in the
[`latest`](./en/latest/) directory.

## Translations
Translations can be contributed by creating a new directory for the language following the [ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) standard. For example, the Spanish translation would be in `es/`. Furthermore, the website configuration needs to be updated to include the new language. The configuration is located in [`config.toml`](../website/config.toml) and the `languages` array needs to be updated with the new language. For example, the Spanish translation would be added as `es` to the `languages` array.

The edition in the `latest` branch is published to TAG App Delivery's website at
