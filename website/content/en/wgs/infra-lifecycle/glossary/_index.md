If you wish to refer to these definitions outside the scope of the working group’s papers, please note that they have been written in the context of both the CNCF and infrastructure management.

## Infrastructure Lifecycle
The continuous process of designing, deploying, operating, updating, and decommissioning infrastructure resources. This lifecycle covers stages from provisioning to maintenance and eventual retirement, with a focus on resilience, security, sustainability, and automation.

## Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
A practice where infrastructure is managed and provisioned through machine-readable configuration files, enabling consistency and scalability. Allowing infrastructure to be treated as code, enabling version control, testing, and automation of infrastructure management.

## State
In infrastructure management, state refers to the current configuration, status, and condition of infrastructure resources at any given point in time. It captures details like resource attributes, dependencies, and operational status, often stored in a state file.

## State Drift
A condition in which the actual state of infrastructure resources deviates from the desired state defined in code. Mechanisms like drift detection and reconciliation are used to identify and correct these discrepancies.
