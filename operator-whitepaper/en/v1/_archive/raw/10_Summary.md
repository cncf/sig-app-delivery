## Conclusion
**(Current) Issue: https://github.com/cncf/sig-app-delivery/issues/46**

Originally, operators were a first class solution for onboarding stateful applications into orchestrators that usually tackled the operation of stateless workloads. They enhanced their APIs and increased the power of container orchestrators further but didn’t resolve all problems of application configuration and “Day 2” operations. It is important to keep in mind that Operators are a pattern to manage specific requirements and facilitate operations but they also bring complexities that should be weighed up before being implemented.
