KubeCon EU 2024 is only four more weeks away!  
The TAG App Delivery is excited to bring together cloud-native application developers
and framework builders to meet each other and share insights and knowledge.
Our goal is to make cloud development better for all by gathering feedback,
finding synergies and guiding both users and projects.

## TAG booth
You can find the TAG App Delivery at our booth **PP19-A** in the project pavilion,
where we will have lightning talks and showcase the work of the platforms and artifact working groups.

**The CfP for lightning talks is now closed.**

Please note the following requirements to submit a talk propsal
- The topic should be relevant to the TAG app-delivery. If in doubt, refer to [our charter](https://tag-app-delivery.cncf.io/)
- When submitting project presentations, keep in mind that we will only accept CNCF projects, or projects submitted to CNCF sandbox.
- Lightning talks will be a maximum of 10 minutes, a computer display can not be guaranteed.
The call for proposals ends March 3rd. If your talk is accepted, we will notify you by March 9th.
If you did not hear back from us, your submission has unfortunately not been accepted.


## TAG presentations
We will also have two presentations at KubeCon itself.

On Tuesday, Tech Lead Lian Li will give [A Quick Look at the TAG App Delivery](https://sched.co/1aQgL) in the form of a lightning talk.

On Thursday, TAG chair Thomas Schuetz and Tech Lead Lian Li will talk about [the everchanging landscape of cloud-native application delivery](https://sched.co/1YhhV) and how that influences the scope of our work in the TAG.

We will continuously update the below schedule as more information becomes available.
