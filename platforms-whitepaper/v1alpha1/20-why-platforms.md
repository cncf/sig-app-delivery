## Why a platform is valuable

What economic and business reasons motivate enterprises to implement platforms?
The value of platforms emerges from a) the consolidation of shared capabilities
in a team of experts focused on b) making those services and capabilities easy
to integrate and use in digital products and applications.

Enterprises adopting platform engineering can expect to achieve the following:

1. Accelerate product and feature development by intentionally dedicating teams to platform capabilities and reducing cognitive load on product teams
1. Accelerate product development by reusing and sharing practices and knowledge about platform capabilities across product teams
1. Improve quality and accelerate adoption of platform capabilities in products by selecting experts to develop and manage those capabilities
1. Reduce costs of procuring and using platform capabilities by outsourcing implementations while still managing interfaces and experiences

Platform teams focus on capabilities required by many product teams, so their
impact is multiplied. A team of platform experts not only reduces common work
[1] demanded of product teams but also accelerates adoption of new capabilities
[3] in those products. And because a platform offers standards for many
capabilities, knowledge and practices about those is shared [2] and developers
can quickly contribute to new products. Finally, because platform teams corral
capability providers and provide consistent experiences for them, they enable
consolidation and outsourcing [4] of development and operation of these
foundational but undifferentiated capabilities.

Top use cases an enterprise can meet with a basic platform include the following:

1. Developers of first-party products and services can automatically provision capabilities such as compute runtimes, storage space and service identity and immediately integrate and use those capabilities in digital products.
1. Developers of first-party products and services can automatically provision supporting services such as task runners, package registries, deployment orchestrators and observability systems to build, verify, operate and observe products and services.
1. Operators of third-party products and services can automatically provision spaces and supporting services to deploy and use those third-party products and services.

As mentioned in the previous section, platforms can include scenario-oriented
templates and cater to more specific use cases too. For example, a developer
platform includes templates for provisioning complete development environments
and serves the following use cases:

1. Developers of products or services can automatically request a complete development environment to support iterative research and development of new features. This includes spaces in relevant services, membership for team members in those spaces, and publication of connection info such as URLs and secrets.
1. Developers of products or services can use scenario-specific code templates to quickly develop new products and features to run in such a standard environment.
1. Developers of products or services can automatically request complete build, test and production environments for research, development and deployment to production. This includes relevant task runner services, artifact storage services and workload delivery and verification services. It must also include production-like equivalents of platform capabilities for use in tests.
1. All stakeholders in a product or service can observe system and user behavior in their products and services via instrumentation, dashboards and alerts.
