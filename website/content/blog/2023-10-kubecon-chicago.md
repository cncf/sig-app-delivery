At Kubecon Chicago TAG App Delivery will bring together maintainers and users of
projects that enable cloud-native application delivery to meet and learn from
each other. The TAG's goals as always are to a) enable application delivery projects
to learn from each other and from cloud application developers and b) make
application delivery faster and more efficient for end users.
 
To this end the TAG will host
[a project meeting](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america/program/project-engagement/#in-person-project-working-session)
on Monday morning at [the Marriott Marquis](https://maps.app.goo.gl/6gczBxScup8Cn6tBA) on Level 4, room name "Probability"; and booth 41 in
[the project pavilion](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america/program/project-engagement/#project-pavilion)
at the conference center on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. At these venues we'll be hosting talks and discussions about app
delivery topics; if you'd like to share an open source project,
a new idea, or just lead an open discussion please let us know by filling out

Here's that info again:
