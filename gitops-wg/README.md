The GitOps WG focus was to clearly define a vendor-neutral, principle-led meaning of GitOps, which will establish a foundation for interoperability between tools, conformance, and certification.
Lasting GitOps programs, documents, and code live within the CNCF OpenGitOps project.

See the original WG charter here: <https://github.com/cncf/tag-app-delivery/blob/master/gitops-wg/charter.md>

For more history on the GitOps WG, see the TAG App Delivery repo's git history, as well as <https://github.com/open-gitops/project>.

## GitOps Principles

The GitOps Principles aim to give participants in the cloud native ecosystem a common understanding of GitOps systems based on shared principles, rather than individual opinion or implementation preference, as the foundation for GitOps practices.

See current releases of the Principles and other documents here: <https://github.com/open-gitops/documents/releases>
